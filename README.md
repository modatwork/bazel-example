This is a demo Bazel project to show one case where LSP server (clangd) fails to work with the `compile_commands.json` generated by the tool https://github.com/hedronvision/bazel-compile-commands-extractor.

## How to reproduce

The following steps are tested on macOS 13.5.2, clangd 18.1.1 and bazel 6.3.2.

```shell
# get the source code
git clone https://github.com/modatwork/bazel-example.git
cd bazel-example
git checkout v0.1.0

# first build the project
bazel build bar

# generate the compile_commands.json
bazel run :refresh_compile_commands

vim bar.cc
```

After jumping to the definition of `add` function the LSP server complains that `Failed to find compilation database for /Users/moda/.cache/bazel/b92409a607afcdd077412f77b2f754f6/external/foo/foo.h\n"`.

There is a `compile_commands.json` file in the `bazel-example` directory which has compile command for "external/foo/foo". But it's not used by clangd.
